Objective
To provide digiramp users the best qualifyed music based on requests


The system is composed of some basic parts


1: an inital who provides the first dataset
2: an artifical inteligence hereby called Dirac
3: a large group of people requesting music
4: a usage history of each track reccomended
5: reputations for personas. (submitter, requester, IPI's)






Flow

pt. 1
The initial user creates the first data set and submit it
The dataset is composed of:
  a: an audio file for a spectrum analysics
  b: ID3 tags
  c: Lyrics
  d: Informations about the work
  e: Informations about the master

pt. 2
Dirac stores the dataset and qualify it based on 
  a: The tags scaled by initial users reputation
  b: The work ipi's reputation (composer, writer...)
  c: The lyrics
  d: The master ipi's reputation (artist, producer...)
  e: (Dirac can lookup online databases. Wikipedia. e.t.c.)
  
pt. 3
The requester submits a request to Dirac who process the request
in a neural network and match the recomendation to the requesters reputation
  a: Dirac makes a recomendation/s 
  b: To each recomandation is attach a history log
  
pt. 4
The requester interacts with the reccomendation
  a: the user does nothing
  b: the user play some of the recomendation
  c: the user plays the entire reccomendation
  d: the user likes the reccomendation
  e: the user add the reccomendation to a playlist
  f: the user share the reccomendation
  g: the user submit the reccomendation to an opportunity
  h: the user looks at the owners profile
  i: the user contact the owner
  j: the user follows the owner
  k: the user listen to other recordings by the owner
  
Every time there has been an interaction Dirac is notifyed

pt. 5
Dirac learns from the user interaction
