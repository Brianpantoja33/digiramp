It is agreed that Publicist shall not be deemed in default hereunder unless and until Artist shall first deliver to Publicist by written notice, registered mail describing the exact nature of the service which Artist requires of Publicist and then only in the event that Publicist shall therefore fail for a period of fifteen (15) consecutive days to commence the rendition for the particular service required. The parties agree that Artist shall not be in default hereunder unless and until Publicist has notified Artist by written, registered mail about the work that Publicist considers Artist is duty-bound to perform in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement entered into by Publicist under the authority of this Agreement.13.

Should any portion of this Agreement be found to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity of the balance of this Agreement.18. Artist and Publicist each warrant to the other that each is able to enter into and abide by the terms of this agreement, that there are no existing agreements which would interfere with the pursuit of each of the tasks each agrees to perform. THE PARTIES HEREBY agree to and will abide by the terms of this Agreement by so setting their names below. ____________________________ ARTIST ____________________________By: ____________________________PUBLICIST ____________________________By:THE STATE OF _______ )COUNTY OF __________ ) I, ________________________________, a Notary Public, do hereby certify that on this ____________day of ________________,199__, personally appeared before me _______________, known to me to be the person whose name is subscriber to the foregoing instrument, and swore and acknowledged to me that he executed the same for the purpose and in the capacity therein expressed, and that the statements contained therein are true and correct.__________________________________NOTARY PUBLIC, STATE OF _________________________________________________Name, Typed or PrintedMy Commission Expires: __________________
