we all know how fun it is to be a mussician

- first I write some great music
- Then I record the music
- All my fans loves your music and you become ritch


-SCRATZZZZ SOUND

- But that's not how it works
- Ther is money enough in the music business but not in my pocket?


- lets take it one more time

- first i write the music, maybe i only writes the lyrics and some one else writes the music 
- and you might have a publisher
- and the other people has their publisher
- and ther might als be an administrator
- and someone collects the music for records and an other collect for public usage
- so all of you each have a share in the music and any income should be split among you and you are what is called an interested party
- when the work is registered there is organizations that collects and distribute the money from usage in the radio and other public places
- this organizations is called a performance rights organization, you might have one and some of the other might have other one and, they don't send the money at the same time so it's har to figure wha't going on



- Then you music is produced, by you ore someone else, this involves other mussicians, producers, remixers and a lot of other people they are also called called Interested Parties
- Now you or some else, for instance labels, representatives can sell your music
- but one thing is missing no one know about your music.
- So without a big marketing budget you turn to social medias and give it away on facebook, twitter, youtube, sound cloud and a ton of other places, then someone will know about it, and if you don't do it youself it's likely someone els will do it for you, but so far you haven't seen a dime
- let's say your music catch on and someone want to use the music professional great now it smells like money.

- Lets say some on buy the work or the recording or both for a film or a brand new album for a superstar and it make it all whe way to the day befor the premier, 
- HURRY you did it.... not

-SCRATZZZZ SOUND
One of the IP's could show up and claim a million and stop the premier, 
so that don't work.

- and this is what is what the buyer is there for, by the way buyers are often called music supervisors or managers for the superstars
- their job is to make sure all the contracts between the interested parties for the music and for the music production is done right.

- So your music might be great music and the recording is world class. but no one dare to use profecionaly and everybody can listen o it for free
- If a little money is collected by the performance rights organization, you could get lucky and get a share of a share. maybe enough for one great cigar
but not enough to make you happy
- and if you are on of the people involved in the production who is collecting the money and do they share with you let's in 5 years

- and what if you want to sell all your rights? or someone ip  just don't want you to use the music like you want to, or some stole you music, or one of the other ipi's sold the music but you did'n get your share?
