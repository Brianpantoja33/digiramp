Hi Peter and Kim
I was in CBH Friday and Saturday. So I just started collecting data for a business strategy

Im working in a few paralell lanes, after gathering some data today I will try to draft an outline for a strategy as I see it. Take it as a proposal and work in progress we can use for futher refinement and as an ongoing process

I'm sending this now hance I would like to draw on your expertice early and often.
Maybe we should work in cycles. planing. execution. evaluation. party. 


Lanes

1:
- Evaluat the Licensing market vs the Mechanical. 
after 2 hours of reading my first Impression is the Licensing market is the deal when it comes to size and the lack of good implementation from competitors
for a quick read 5-10 min. this is exelent http://infographicjournal.com/state-of-the-music-licensing-industry-2013/
I don't have any expirences regarding buying industry reports but there is a few out there. they seems a little costy
but might be worth the price

2:
The web 2. 
I will try to estimate the value of Spotify / Sound Cloud / Youtube / Amazon / Apple and profile them against DigiRAMP.
  Based on users, Business model. Technology. Integration. Market share.
  
3:
- Readyness. If and when DigiRAMP has proven it's value. what would it take from here to point wher DigiRAMP can kick start one of the malor online players / be sold

- what is the time frame
- how can DigiRAMP protect IP
- what technology
- how big marked share
- what could the value be


4:
Product profiling. 
First impression is that when I look at the Licensing we have few kind of outdated competitors and a real opportunity to gather a strong position fast
As a social platform the competitor is SoundCloud, we match when it comes to technology, supass on the business model and features and is non existent when it comes to users and content
 
Apple has a uniq strong position when it comes to Mecanicals and Integration. The integration is not unbreakble.
Spotify has a uniq position in the streaming business.

A note about:
Youtube. Viemo

5:
The why DigiRAMP and how we can present DigiRAMP. we want to winn the harts and the minds of the users

Head to head against Jahoo. No ads No moderators, free fast.




DigiRAMP have the deepest respects for people who work and live for the music.
But the money disapears on its way to the creators. 
DigiRAMP is fixing that



More music sold online by more and more artists gennerates more and more income. 
Not from records sold but from streaming usage with moving pictures and added value 
to smart phones and other products.






DigiRAMP lets the money flow in realtime to all parties. 
Transparent using micro transactions. No treshold. no delay. No big fees
Creators can become their own label and publisher and get between 80 - 90 % of the income
Compared to 5 to 75% as it is now
At DigiRAMP we beleive it's not only about the money. 
It's also about the reconition. 
Small money in the bank is also reconition
