We all know how fun it is work with music

- First you write some great music
- Then you record the music
- Finaly all the fans loves the music and you become ritch...


-SCRATZZZZ SOUND NOT!!!

- But that's not how it works
- Howcome is the money not landing in your pocket


- lets take it one more time

- first you write the music and maybe some one else writes the lyrics and you are using a melody one of your friends created 
- and you might have a publisher
- and the other people can have totaly different publishers
- and ther might also be an administrator and even other people with interests in the music
- and someone receive the money for public usage of the music and someone else collect money for sale of cd's and merchandice
- so all of you each have a share in the music and any income should be split among you and you are what is called an interested party
- when the work is registered there is organizations that collects and distribute the money from usage of music in the radio and other public places
- this organizations is called a performance rights organization, you might have one and some of the other might have other ones an, they don't send the money at the same time so it's hard to figure what's going on and who receives what when



- Then you music is produced, by you ore someone else, this involves other mussicians, producers, remixers and a lot of other people they are also called called Interested Parties
- Now you or some else, for instance labels, managers, administrators or representatives can sell the music
- But one thing is missing no one know about your music.
- So without a big marketing budget you turn to social medias and give the music away for free on facebook, twitter, youtube, sound cloud and a ton of other places
- And maybe some of the othere interested parties get mad at you and call you a criminal,
- But at least there is a chance someone know about the music
- And if you given away the music it's likely someone else would have done is so why not do your self
- And so far you haven't seen a dime
- let's say your music catch on and someone want to use the music professional great now it smells like money.

- Lets say some on buy the work or the recording or both for a film or a brand new album or for a superstar or maybe all of it and it make it all whe way to the day befor the premier, 
- HURRY you did it.... 

-SCRATZZZZ SOUND NOT!!!

One of the IP's could show up and claim a million and stop the premier, 
so that don't work.

- and this is what is what the buyer is there for, by the way buyers are often called music supervisors or managers for the superstars
- their job is to make sure all the contracts between the interested parties for the music and for the music production is done right.

- So your music might be great music and the recording is world class. but no one dare to use it profecionaly and everybody can listen o it for free
- If a little money is collected by the performance rights organization, you could get lucky and get a share of a share. maybe enough for one great cigar
but not enough to make you happy for more than the time it takes to smoke that cigar
- and if you are on of the people involved in the production. who is then collecting the money. are you sure they remember to share with you let's say in 5 years

- and what if you want to sell all your rights? or if some of the other ipis just don't want you to use the music like you want to, or some stole you music, or one of the other ipi's sold the music but you did'n get your share?

- now it's time to run screaming away. You just want to have a great time with music and now you can't smoke a cigar without beeing called a criminal
